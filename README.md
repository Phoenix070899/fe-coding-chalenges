## Problem 1: Three Ways to Sum to `n`

In the `index.js` file, you’ll find three different approaches to calculate the sum from `1` to `n`:
1. Using a mathematical formula  
2. Using a `for` loop  
3. Using recursion

## Problem 2: Fancy Form

A responsive React-based form that allows users to exchange assets. Key features include:

- **Responsive UI** built with TailwindCSS  
- **Asset fetching** with mocked delay and a dropdown selector  
- **State management** with hooks for loading, error handling, and data validation  
- **Form validation** for amounts, including error messages and loading states  
- **Swap functionality** to switch between “send” and “receive” assets  

### Run the project
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

## Problem 3: Messy React

- In [inefficient-found.md](https://github.com/Phoenix070899/fe-coding-chalenges/blob/main/problem3-messy-react/inefficient-found.md) file, I've commented what need to fix 
- In [refactor.md](https://github.com/Phoenix070899/fe-coding-chalenges/blob/main/problem3-messy-react/refactor.md) file, I've refactored into cleaner version
